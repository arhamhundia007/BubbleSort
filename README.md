# BubbleSort
# This program helps you experience how Bubble sort code looks like, if you want to see in detail then just take the code and debug to see how it actually works
# To change the best case to O(N) then create a boolean variable to check if there are any swaps in each iteration. An check if it is false as if that happens you can exit the program as the array is sorted.
# Worstcase: O(N^2)
# Bestcase: O(N^2)
